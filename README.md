# Users-list-and-form-using-local-storage

## To view the project You can use the Live Server provided by VS code.

This project contains a list of sample users and a pretty basic form that allows the user to add a new item to the list. 
All the magic happens thanks to the local storage. 
Check out the cool gradient in the "add" button and the visualization of the loading progress.
